# C Programming Memory Concepts & Tutorials

A comprehensive collection of educational materials covering memory management, system programming concepts, and comparative programming language analysis.

## Contents

### Core Memory Management
- **[MemoryLayout.md](./MemoryLayout.md)** - Detailed explanation of program memory layout, stack vs heap, and step-by-step execution tracing
- **[memorylayout_py.md](./memorylayout_py.md)** - Python memory management comparison, variable storage, and garbage collection concepts
- **[memorylayout_asm.md](./memorylayout_asm.md)** - Assembly language perspective on memory and low-level system operations

### Programming Fundamentals
- **[pointer_arithmetic.md](./pointer_arithmetic.md)** - Comprehensive guide to pointer operations and memory addressing
- **[tutorial.md](./tutorial.md)** - General programming tutorials and examples

### System References
- **[page_ref.md](./page_ref.md)** - System-level memory management and paging concepts

## Key Topics Covered

### Memory Management
- Stack vs Heap allocation strategies
- Function call mechanics and stack frames
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`/`free`
- Memory address relationships and debugging
- Automatic vs manual memory management

### Language Comparisons
- **C**: Manual memory management, direct hardware access
- **Python**: Automatic garbage collection, reference counting, memory safety
- **Assembly**: Low-level system operations and direct memory manipulation

### Educational Focus
- Step-by-step program execution tracing
- Visual memory layout diagrams
- Practical code examples with detailed explanations
- Common pitfalls and best practices
- Performance vs safety trade-offs

## Getting Started

1. Start with **[MemoryLayout.md](./MemoryLayout.md)** for foundational C memory concepts
2. Review **[pointer_arithmetic.md](./pointer_arithmetic.md)** for pointer operations
3. Compare with **[memorylayout_py.md](./memorylayout_py.md)** to understand modern language approaches
4. Explore **[memorylayout_asm.md](./memorylayout_asm.md)** for low-level system understanding

## Target Audience

- Computer science students learning systems programming
