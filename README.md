### Exercises
- **[exercises.md](./exercises.md)** - 50 hands-on coding exercises for mastering pointer logic and complex control flow
- **[hints.md](./hints.md)** - Detailed hints and testing strategies for each exercise 

## Key Topics Covered

### Memory Management
- Stack vs Heap allocation strategies
- Function call mechanics and stack frames
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`/`free`
- Memory address relationships and debugging
- Automatic vs manual memory management

### Language Comparisons
- **C**: Manual memory management, direct hardware access
- **Python**: Automatic garbage collection, reference counting, memory safety
- **Assembly**: Low-level system operations and direct memory manipulation

### Educational Focus
- Step-by-step program execution tracing
- Visual memory layout diagrams
- **Hands-on coding exercises** with progressive difficulty
- **Complex logic and branching challenges** for skill development
- Practical code examples with detailed explanations
- Common pitfalls and best practices
- Performance vs safety trade-offs

## Getting Started

1. Begin with **[tutorial.md](./tutorial.md)** for an introduction to C memory management
2. Study **[pointer_arithmetic.md](./pointer_arithmetic.md)** for comprehensive understanding of pointer operations
3. Dive deep into **[memorylayout_c.md](./memorylayout_c.md)** for detailed memory layout concepts
4. Compare with **[memorylayout_py.md](./memorylayout_py.md)** and **[memorylayout_asm.md](./memorylayout_asm.md)** for language perspectives
5. Reference **[page_ref.md](./page_ref.md)** for system-level memory management concepts
6. Practice with **[exercises.md](./exercises.md)** - 50 progressive coding challenges to master pointer logic
7. Use **[hints.md](./hints.md)** when stuck - provides guidance without revealing solutions

## Target Audience
